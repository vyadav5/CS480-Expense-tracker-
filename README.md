DATABASE DESCRIPTION 

This database helps users to keep track of their expenses and savings. The system consists of 4 entities(User, expense,savings, category). It can keep track of multiple userswhere each user entity has its own unique user_id and name. Users can add, delete and update the expenses where expensense entity is related to a user using user_id and its own unique expense_id name, amount. date of creation and category. Users may also add, delete, update the savings and they can also add any number of Expense/Savings and keep track of those. The system help by providing the user daily,monthly and yearly statistic of their expenses. 

MOTIVATION TOWARDS CHOOSING THE TOPIC 

I want to create an expense tracker database that would help the users to keep track of their monthly and yearly expense. The user will choose a certain category first, for eg. rent, gym membership or groceries, then add their expenses related to them.They are free to add their savings based on their expenses. This app will provide the help of daily statistics that would help them to manage their expense and debts on a daily basis. My idea towards creating this database is to keep ther user free of debts and have peace of mind by guiding them where they are spending their money. There are several reasons people would want to track their expenses. This database will help people to acheive their desired goal by tracking and spending wisely.
